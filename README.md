# Introduction



## Flows organization

We have 3 ***"tiers"***:
+ corpus-flow
+ corpora-flow
+ visual-flow

Corpus-flow is the machine in the factory.
Corpora-flow is the belt, on which texts are presented to the machine.
Visual-flow is the shelf, or series of shelves, on which you put the products to admire and compare them.

### Corpus-flow

It executes literary tasks against one corpus (i.e. a novel). It is generic in a sense that it can be executed for different corpora. In order to run it for particular corpus, or multiple corpora, we use a corpora-flow.
